# epidemic-SEIHRD-microsimulation
Python implementation of a simple microsimulation with compartmental epidemic dynamics (SEIHRD) Â (C) Averisera Ltd 2020.

The model is a simple microsimulation of a hypothetical population undergoing a contagion described by a compartmental (SEIHRD) model.
Each person in the population has a family of arbitrary size and interacts with arbitrary frequency with an arbitrary number of randomly selected extrafamilial persons. The contagion spreads through contacts between individuals, who undergo transitions between different stages of the disease as described by the SEIHRD model: S(usceptible), E(exposed), I(nfected), H(ospitalised), R(ecovered) or (D)ead.
The model can be used to test the effects of varying the number and frequency of external contacts on the disease impact (e.g. number of deaths or hospitalisations) providing a simplistic simulation of the effects of self-isolation policy interventions.
